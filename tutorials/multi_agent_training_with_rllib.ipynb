    "Welcome! This tutorial is the first of a series on doing distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Here, we specifically demonstrate how to integrate our multi-agent economic simulation, [Foundation](https://github.com/salesforce/ai-economist/tree/master/ai_economist/foundation), with [RLlib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib), an open-source library for reinforcement learning.

    "- Provide reference starting code to perform MARL training so the AI Economist community can focus more on building meaningful extensions to Foundation and better-performant algorithms.\n",

    "1. Adding an *environment wrapper* to make the economic simulation compatible with RLlib.\n",
